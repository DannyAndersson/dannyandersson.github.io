    <h3>Why music?</h3>
    <p>Let me get one thing straight - I am not a musician. I don't pretend to be one. I have  "projects," and none of them are fully finished. Just for convenience, I've included selected tracks from each of them on this page. I'd say "enjoy" but since I know what these sound like, I'm certain you'll be doing the opposite of that..</p>
    <h3>What are the projects?</h3>
    <p>well, we've got:</p>

    <div class="album-content">
        <h2>Rare Jazz</h2>
        <img src="../resources/rj.jpg" alt="Album cover art for Rare Jazz - a blurry picture of a plant with 'Basil' written on it." class="album-image" style="width: 300px">
        <p style="max-width: 45%">Rare Jazz was both started and abandoned in 2021. It was meant to be an experimental album which, despite what the name might have you believe, had fuck-all to do with jazz. I ended up making 3 tracks for it, two of which have since been lost due to a hard drive crash. Oh, the joys of RAID 0.<br><br>The surviving song is an early demo which includes no lyrics, and has not been mixed nor mastered. Straight outta MuseScore, just like god intended.<br><br>At the very least, I can say that this album set the precedent for all that would follow it - rule one: plagariaze, rule two: be as shitty as possible.<br>

        <h2>Basilika Musik</h2>
        <img src="../resources/bm.jpg" alt="Album cover art for Basilika Musik - a hand with a poorly photoshopped picture of bread in it, overlaid on top of a blurry background of basil leaves" class="album-image" style="width: 300px">
        <p style="max-width: 45%">This is part of one of my friend's albums, actually. Oskar Karlsson, who last year undertook this very course, is a talented musician and is working on his first full length album. For one of the tracks, he asked me to be the vocalist as he played guitar. This is the result.<br><br>While it's not exactly listenable, it's certainly music, which is more than can be said for my other works. This song is actually published on Spotify, Apple Music, and all other major distributors. Don't ask how.<br><br>Ironically enough, the subject matter is more closely linked to my other projects than you may think. Not in a good way.<br>
