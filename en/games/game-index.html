                <p>This was based off of an old ice cream commercial based platformer game, which was showcased by Vinesauce Joel during a Windows Destruction livestream. It was made to be intentionally bad. Compound that on the fact that everything I make is awful by default, and you should be concerned.

            <p>The unfinished sequel to Coconuts on Earth. It shows improvement design-wise, but a lacking in many other important areas, which ultimately led to it never being completed. It cuts off rather suddenly after reaching a nature preserve.
                I once again cannot recommend this game. It is more playable than those that came before it, but that's like saying a broken leg is better than a broken arm. It's still broken, and at the end of the day, you want neither.

            <p>A sequel/upgrade to Coconuts in Space, except after the events of the first game, the coconuts are on earth. <i>How exciting!</i>... or maybe not.<br><br>
               This is, like its predecessor, very far from good. This time, there are even more horrible assets in the mix, and a "story," complete with awful cutscenes. Once again, this was basically just a way for my very young self to learn the engine's fundamentals. It's not playable by any means.</p>

            <p>I was 12 and I had just barely started figuring out Unity when I made this. While technically my second game on the engine, I consider it the only one that is playable (not to be confused with 'good'. it is <i>far</i> from that.) En contraire, it is borderline uncontrollable, and a hodge-podge of random assets.<br><br>The premise? You're a coconut, located on a space station of some kind. Your goal is to leave. Other coconuts are trying to stop you. That is all.</p>
