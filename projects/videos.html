        <h3>Ever since I torrented that copy of Sony Vegas 11 back in 2016, shit's just never been the same.</h3>
        <h4>Here's some of the funky little video projects I've made since then. Some have copyrighted materials and thus are not able to be displayed on this page.</h4>

                    For Svenska 1, they wanted us to make a short film talking about the different types of words. Y'know, nouns, verbs...<br>And we sort of did that. Just barely went insane.</li>

                    And for Kemi 1, we had to make a similar video about our favourite chemical bonds. Because everyone has one of those.<br>Anyway, this one's okay. Not all the jokes land. Surprisingly informative? The insanity segment at the end is a bit forced.

                    Nordenbergsskolan celebrates the international "language day," and since I had the misfortune of learning French, I had to make... this.<br>I'm pretty sure this is offensive to the entire nation of France, but hey, c'est la culture de France!

                    One time, they just straight up asked us to make an advertisement for the school. Like, not even sugar-coating it.<br>Paired us into groups and gave us an afternoon. So I did my best to capture the essence of the school.

                    I consider this one of my better works. This one was for Fysik 1, where our group had to talk about the Ideal Gas Law.<br>One thing led to another, and it turned into a found-footage analogue horror film. Whoops!<br>It's rough around the edges, and the time crunch definitely shows, plus the inspiration/plagiarism from Spamton Sweepstakes is apparent.<br>Yet still, I find it great from an editing perspective.

                    Full disclosure, this wasn't <i>my</i> school project, I instead helped out one of my friends who's still in 9th grade.<br>For her English class, she had to make an instructional video. She chose to show people how to open a bottle.<br>Let's just say things got out of hand on set.

                    As above, this is the same friend's project. She also has French class, thus perpetuating the cycle of despair.<br>She had to make a baking video, so... we made this.. thing? I don't even know if she passed.<br>Fun fact, there was a major injury on set during the filming of this. See if you can spot it in the video.
